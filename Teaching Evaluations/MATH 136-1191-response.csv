I know that the course staff seem to feel that quiz performance may better reflect exam performance, but I find that not only do I do better in courses with assignments, but I find that I come out of those courses understanding far more material. For example, in first semester, before the final exam, my Algebra mark was far higher than my Calculus mark, and I think I can attribute most of that to the assignments. I find that assignments help me to actually think through and understand course content, whereas quizzes just end up with me scrambling for answers when I take them, and I end up doing far less practice than with assignments. I hope that in the future, this course goes back to an assignment based model, since it will allow future students to actually understand proofs rather than being forced to come up with a serviceable answer in under an hour.",7-10 hours,2,,,,"Mukto was very informative, friendly, and quite often an entertaining lecturer.",,,"No complaints.
