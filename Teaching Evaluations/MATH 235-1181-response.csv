If you have 3 questions correct with confidence, and 1 question incorrect without confidence, you'd get 5/8 on the multiple choice section, which is a 62.5%. 3/4 correct should not give you a 62.5%, and I would have disliked the quizzes far less if leaving a question blank did not also result in a -1 for that question, and the maximum mark had been 4 or perhaps 6, instead of 8.
