HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO LEARN PROOFS IF I HAVE LIKE 2 COMPLETED PROOFS PER SECTION FROM THE TEXTBOOK AND LIKE 2 PROOFS FROM THE LECTURE???? IN CALCULUS MATH 137 THEY HAVE 60 questions! 60+ FREAKING QUESTIONS per section and WE ARE PROVIDED A FULL SOLUTION FOR ALL THE ODD NUMBERS! THATS AT LEAST 30 FULL SOLUTIONS PER SECTION THAT I CAN STUDY AND LEARN. OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE FIND THIS COURSE HARD, STUDENTS NEED A WAY TO PRACTICE AND SEE THE FULL SOLUTION FOR A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS. AT LEAST DIRECT STUDENTS TO LIKE THE DISCRETE MATHS TEXTBOOK OR SOMETHING

ALSO THE EXPLANATIONS IN THE TEXTBOOK ARE CRAP! THEY SKIP LIKE 20 THINGS PER STEP AND STUDENTS NEED TO SPEND LIKE 50% OF THEIR TIME JUST TRYING TO COMPREHEND WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN STEP 4 AND 5, but i admit maybe that's just me cause i find this hard, so like that's kinda subjective...a bit more description per step would be helpful

I JUST WANT A CRAP-TON OF PRACTICE PROBLEMS WITH FULL SOLUTIONS PROVIDED SO I CAN LEARN HOW TO PROVE THINGS. (sry all-caps)
