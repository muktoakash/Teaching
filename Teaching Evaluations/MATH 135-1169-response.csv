215815,2016-12-05T10:08:14-05:00,Good,1,,Somewhat too high,1,Since a lot of this material is quite new sometimes I would have appreciated a bit more of an explanation of where things came from as new concepts were used the first few times.,Excellent,0,Mukto was always very receptive to questions and always tried his best to answer them. I always felt welcome to ask a question and never felt like I was being judged for asking a simple question! THANK YOU MUKTO!,Excellent,0,,Excellent,0,,Available,0,,Interesting,1,,Good,1,I thought Mukto did a great job at explaining things for the most part! Thank you!,90-100%,0,,Helpful,1,These assignments I did find very challenging though at times! They took multiple multiple hours for me at times!,No printed notes,3,,Very helpful,0,,Somewhat too much,1,,Somewhat too much,1,,7-10 hours,2,,,,I loved Mukto's enthusiasm for what we were learning!!,,,"I don't know if this necessarily falls under technique style but I had a really hard time in this course during the last two weeks when we learned polynomials due to the fact that we got behind in the class and then were trying to get through everything in time to complete the assignment but not really with enough time to understand it! I found it slightly difficult to just accept every theorem for polynomials at face value for a week and then to have to ""un-accept"" them and have to prove them. I would have preferred if we would have been able to learn it in the intended order! I also would have loved a review class instead of a class on a random concept that we will not be tested on!",,,I loved the RSA part of the course!! I thought that was so so so so interesting!,,,I found sometimes this course was an overload since a lot of it was SOOO new but over time this got a bit better.,,,I thought our class had a fantastic atmosphere! I always felt welcome to ask questions and I thought everyone was welcoming of other people's questions too!,,,I loved the class size! It was nice to have a smaller class!
