Had online office hours before Waterloo shut down (which I found to be helpful)",,,I liked it better when you used the blackboard vs. slides,,,Pretty interesting material,,,I feel like the grading scheme is a little poor now after everything happened and Waterloo shut down,,,Mukto was very welcoming of everyone; never put anyone on the spot or made them uncomfortable. Good job overall.,,,Lecture hall was very big for the number of people in it; there were maybe 20-30 people in the lecture hall that looks like it is for at least a couple hundred people.

While his PowerPoints are a great resource, I felt his lectures were much better when he wrote directly on the board.",,,"The course is very effective at improving upon established proof techniques from MATH135 while also making students comfortable with the abstract and often unimaginable world of Linear Algebra. On a more specific note, I felt the course notes for this course we're particularly well written and easy to follow.",,,"I felt that the quiz system did not always reward students for their efforts to study, and did not always give a good indicator of learning progress, in comparison to assignments. Also, not all the practice problems provided had solutions, making it difficult for students to know exactly how they were performing.",,,,,,

Like if he did one example last class that already took 20 mins then why do it again next class. We re-did so many things that was pointless.
",,,We learnt a lot of new and interesting stuff,,,"-The overall course wasn't very affective. Like I think assignments would've made us understand the material better and would've actually made me read the textbook.
-I didn't like how when our instructor was gone for a couple of weeks, the instructor we got instead was not prepared at all! That just felt like a waste of time and made me attend other sections
- we were also never ahead of the game as a class which made our instructor teach us during that one week suspension period just to catch up.",,,It was a pleasant atmosphere.,,,I personally couldn't make any friends in that class because it was too big for little amount of students so everyone mostly sat far from each other and thus barely interacted.
