",,,"Instructor teaches math225 and math235 at the same time, but he can not distinguish the differences of  the difficulty between this two courses. He gave 225 students the assignment which has Math 235 assignment printed on it. Also, in the previous math 225 ,there is not that much proofs in the assignments and tests, but he gave us a lot of proof problems which is required for math235. At the same time , he always let the simple knowledge became harder to understand using a lot of definitions....",,,Instructure is very nice to students.,,,Not difficult course but need much time to study by myself,,,Positive,,,Everything is good.

This year, the professor actually made the course about 50% proof based and multiple of the assignments were actually assignments from his MATH 235 class. As a result, 3 students who had taken MATH 225 already and were offering their services as tutors actually told me that they would be unable to tutor me in this course because when they took MATH 225 they had not really had to do ANY proofs at all.",90-100%,0,,Helpful,1,,No printed notes,3,,Very helpful,0,,No opinion,5,,Right amount,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In previous years this course has been very light on the proofs because it is not supposed to be geared towards MATH students but rather towards science, etc. students, since MATH Honours students are required to take MATH 235 instead of MATH 225.
