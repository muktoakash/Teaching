Often times I found that when I listened to what you were saying, I understood what you were trying to teach. However, because of the pace of the teaching, it is usually quite difficult to take down notes and listen at the same time. As a result, when I copy down all the notes, I may have missed something you said verbally, and then when I look back on my notes, I don’t understand what you wrote as I am unfamiliar with the notation. Nevertheless, you’re a great instructor and thank you."

The whole course was utterly confusing but I think that that’s just the way the material is. It might be nice to wait for everyone to catch up and review what just happened and let people process it and ask questions, time allowing. "
