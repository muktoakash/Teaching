I also felt the assignments and quizzes were very good representations of bigger evaluations and so I was rarely surprised when it came to the midterms.,,,"My criticism would be that when questions were asked, be it in class or during office hours, the professor seemed to imply that the student should already know the answer, which was somewhat discouraging. This could be resolved by simply employing the ""no stupid questions"" philosophy more.",,,"I found the content itself to be quite interesting and unlike any other course I'm taking, I found it easy to see the actual applications of much of the course material, which made it easier to motivate myself to do well in this course. The weekly quizzes were sometimes stressful but they did push me to stay up to date on the lessons and actually understand them, so I think they are a good system. I liked when we were given time in class for individual examples and the professor went around and checked our work, it made it easier to catch bad technique and ensure actual engagement not just copying notes.",,,"I found it frustrating at times that the material required for the weekly optional assignments wasn't taught until after their deadline. While the assignments are optional, they're some of the only explicitly assigned practice material and I often found I was just fumbling my way through, so if the deadline for some of the assignments could be pushed to reflect where we're at in the course at that time, that would be helpful.",,,"I found the atmosphere to be fairly neutral, not negative but not particularly positive either. There wasn't a lot of participation by the students which was unfortunate.",,,Good class size.

I feel as though having to know all of these proofs overall distracted from learning how to do the actual processes (i.e. determinants, RREF etc.). Also, I found the amount of proofs on assessments to be a bit too much (i.e. ~50% of questions would be proofs) especially compared to when I last took this course.",,,Atmosphere was fine.,,,
