The course content spikes in difficulty and increase in speed at the same time. You usually want to have the reverse...

I hear linear algebra is useful in a lot of fields yet I still don't know what's the point of orthogonal diagonalization for example. Most of the course feels completely arbitrary and it's unclear why these are powerful tools to use whether in applied sciences or even in pure maths. What is the point and why does it work are the most important things to convey. Reading proofs is easy!",,,,,,Class size is way too big and course staff is obviously overwhelmed.
